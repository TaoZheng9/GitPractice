I was so happy when you smiled,
your smile breaks through the clouds of grey,
far from the sunny days that I lie in asleep.

Waiting with the patience for the spring,
when the flowers will bloom and renew again,
knowing there's more beyond the pain of today.

Although the scars of yesterday remain,
you can go on living as much as your heart believes.

You can't be born again although you can change (Sep6,09:39)

Let's stay together always.

BaBaBa...
